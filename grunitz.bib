  title = {Extraction of the Fetal ECG from Electrocardiographic Long-term Recordings},
  school = {Technische Universität Dresden},
  year = {2011},
  month = {August},
  abstract = {Heart diseases are the cause of many deaths during prenatal, childbirth
	and newborn periods. Therefore, the measurement of the fetal heart
	activity is of great importance in assessing the health state of
	the fetus. In order to evaluate the fetal state, health specialists,
	nowadays, mostly
	
	use the fetal heart rate (fHR) parameter. Many techniques for obtaining
	the fHR are available, however the reliability and 
	
	exibility of these techniques is still not ideal.
	
	
	The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) through abdominal electrodes appears
	to be a suitable solution to the problematic, which provides long-term
	monitoring during the prenatal and childbirth period. The dificulty
	of the fECG technique is the low energy of the fetal signals, which
	often is buried into maternal electrocardiography, electromyographic
	noises, between other noise sources.
	
	
	This presented study contemplates the implementation of a method to
	extract the fHR information from abdominal measurements. Hence, the
	robust Event-Synchronous Canceller (ESC) algorithm, based on template
	subtraction, is implemented. ESC's performance is accordingly tested
	with simulated and real data. Its capability for during long-term
	monitoring is proven and further analysis are discussed. The method
	was capable of detecting the fetal heart beats with an average accuracy
	of 82% when simulated data for the different recording conditions
	were used.
	
	
	Extracting the fECG from abdominal signals is a recent development
	in the biomedical area. Moreover, it is the first work of the biomedical
	engineering research group at the Technische Universitaet Dresden
	in the subject. The result of this work should allow several other
	studies on the topic of the abdominal signals processing, mainly,
	the ones which depend on the acquisition of the fHR information.},

	by human bodies can always be of interest for diagnosis, patient

	biosignals, are usually presented by flat file format or proprietary

	Recent advances in the ubiquitous computing technology make it possible
	to measure biosignal data anywhere and anytime. But a big challenge
	resides in the realm of ubiquitous computing, which is the uniform
	integration and communication of data. This problem also exists in
	the development of the electronic health record and telemedicine.
	Standardizing the data presentation is the best solution to resolve
	these problems. But a general-purpose, effective, user-friendly,
	and universally accepted data format for biosignal is not available
	at this moment. This paper proposes a simple and complete representation
	of biosignal data based on MFER and CDA. It adopts frame structure
	of MFER to encode the waveform data of biosignal and uses hierarchical
	structure of CDA to describe its non-waveform data. This composite
	format not only inherits the advantages of MFER and CDA, but also
	facilitates the implementation of interpretation of biosignal.},
